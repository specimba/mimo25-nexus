## Session 1: Deep Synthesis Session (Pi Agent)

### Status: MAJOR ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Documents Created:
```
.pi/ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md       (22,598 bytes) — System reference
.pi/PRIORITY_WORK_PLAN.md           (8,949 bytes) — Task breakdown
.pi/SWARM_TEAM_DESIGN.md            (14,400 bytes) — Coordination design
.pi/EXPERT_REPORTS_SYNTHESIS.md     (35,289 bytes) — 7-expert deep analysis
```

### Sources Analyzed:
- **7 Expert Reports** (288+ sources): Agent OS, Governance, Memory, A2A, Inference, Training, Models
- **SCORINGFUNCTIONFORMULAconv-01.txt** — v2.1 Trust Scoring System
- **REVIEWGROUND_SCORING_SCHEMA.json** — Review evaluation schema
- **cloud_pack/4_NEXUS_RESEARCH.txt** — Research integration notes

### Key Findings:

#### 1. Trust Scoring (v2.1 Canonical)
- **5-track memory model**: event, trust, capability, failure-pattern, governance
- **Hot/Warm/Cold split**: ~μs scoring, ~ms append, ~s reconciliation
- **Lane-scoped trust**: NOT one global scalar — prevents unfair cross-domain penalization
- **Non-compensatory harm**: R > Rcrit(lane) → score = -1 or hold

#### 2. Memory Architecture (S-P-E-W Upgrade)
- **S → MemPalace**: Verbatim storage, 96.6% LongMemEval
- **P → FAISS**: GPU-accelerated, billions of vectors
- **E → SuperLocalMemory**: Math-based, zero cloud, +16pp over Mem0
- **W → Mira**: Decay-based, earn-or-fade pattern

#### 3. Governance (OWASP ASI 10)
- ASI01-10 full mapping to Bridge/Governor/Vault components
- VAP 4-layer audit: Identity → Provenance → Integrity → Verification
- AgentAssert-ABC: YAML behavioral contracts with hard/soft constraints

#### 4. Model Arsenal Recommendations
- **Add**: MARS-7B (1.5x speedup), Metis-8B (tool efficiency), DeepResearch-30B (SOTA research)
- **Routing**: Domain + Complexity → Model matrix with fallback chains
- **KV Compression**: RotorQuant (10.3x) drop-in for llama.cpp

#### 5. Hot Path Expansion
- Current: ~4.3 μs operations
- Proposed v3: ~14.8 μs (budget check, rate limit, skill match, capability check, priority, audit sign)
- Headroom: 32% under 20 μs target

### Implementation Priority Matrix:

| Phase | Tasks | Hours |
|-------|-------|-------|
| P0 (Sprint 1-2) | Trust hot-path, VAP L1+L2, 5-track schema, SkillFortify ASBOM | ~12 |
| P1 (Sprint 3-5) | AgentAssert contracts, FAISS, SuperLocalMemory, Mira decay, domain partition | ~19 |
| P2 (Sprint 6-8) | MARS, Metis, RotorQuant, priority queues, AReaL | ~10 |
| **Total** | | **~40 hours** |

### Cold Handoff Updates Needed:
- Add trust scoring quick reference
- Add model arsenal matrix
- Add 5-track memory operations
- Update quickstart templates

### Next Actions:
1. SPECI reviews EXPERT_REPORTS_SYNTHESIS.md
2. Team discusses implementation priorities
3. Sprint planning for P0 tasks
4. Update COLD_HANDOFF.txt with v3.1 format

### Critical Integration Review (GODLIKEARCHITECT01 + Qwen_python):

**Key Findings**:
1. **Downloads provide**: Dual-pool architecture, zero-context-loss protocol, circuit breaker, VAP implementation code
2. **My synthesis provides**: 5-track memory, lane-scoped trust, non-compensatory harm, hot/warm/cold split
3. **CRITICAL**: Downloads are missing lane-scoped trust — must add before too late
4. **CRITICAL**: Downloads are missing non-compensatory harm (Rcrit check) — must add
5. **CRITICAL**: Downloads are missing 5-track memory separation — must add

**Action Items**:
- P0: Add 5-track memory, lane-scoped trust, non-compensatory harm, hot/warm/cold boundaries
- P1: Adopt dual-pool, zero-context-loss, circuit breaker, atomic overwrite
- P2: Add latency scoring, handoff packets, VAP record code

**Verdict**: Must combine BOTH sources before scaling. Downloads lack governance layer; my synthesis lacks implementation details.

## 2026-04-16 Documentation & Planning Session (Pi Agent)

### Status: DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

### Actions:
- Created ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md (22KB) — Comprehensive system reference
- Created PRIORITY_WORK_PLAN.md (9KB) — Task breakdown and priorities
- Created SWARM_TEAM_DESIGN.md (14KB) — Coordination layer design
- Fixed DatabaseManager.close_all() method (was missing, causing 24 test errors)
- Fixed test fixtures for Windows file locking
- Analyzed test failures (reduced from 4 failed + 24 errors to 2 failed + 0 errors)

2. **Test stability** improved significantly (24 errors → 0)
3. **Swarm/Team architecture** well-designed, ready for scaling

3. CODEX: Implement TokenGuard → Governor integration
4. PI: Continue monitoring/observability work

### Notes:
- Working on main simultaneously with SPECI
- Avoided file modifications that could conflict
